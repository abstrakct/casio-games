A couple of games I made for the Casio calculator in the late 90s.
I think they were made on a Casio FX-9750.

Uploaded to Github to preserve these for whatever it's worth.
I'm quite proud of what I achieved back then.

Two games:
* Snake
* Snake II

Snake was a simple implementation of the classic snake game.
Snake II was a more sophisticated version, with several levels and the
ability to create your own levels!
The file howto_create_levels.txt explains how to create a level for Snake II.
