What's new?
v1.1: You can now pause the game!
Press 5 to pause and EXE to continue the game. 

v1.0:
YES! Now my snake game finally works just the way it is supposed to work!
The snake grows, if you run into your body you crash and you crash if you
hit the walls (you always have, even in the beta versions). The snake
grows correctly (in beta 0.85 it didn't (I'm not sure if I even put that
version out on the net... did I ?)). When you have eaten the number 9 you
start on 1 again, but keep your score and the speed increases. Oh I
nearly forgot: Now the game calculates your score too! The calculations is
easy: Points = points + (Number eaten)*100
So if you eat the number 3 you get 300 points added to your score! wow!
My high score is 88300! Try to beat that one! I have also changed the
intro a bit, and now I think it is nicer to watch...

The game uses the first 9 cells of list 1 and 2, and the first 2 cells of
list 3 to store coordinates and score and speed.

Thanx go out to:

Hidetake Jo - I used a slightly modified version of his algorithm for
efficient coordinate storing - without it I wouldn't been able to make the
snake grow. Thanx!

Yngve (a friend) for motivating me to write the game; he made me try even
though I thought I couldn't do it. But I did it!

Everyone who has downloaded, tried or played any of my games and everyone
who has visited my homepage.


Controls:
8 - Up
2 - Down
4 - Left
6 - Right
5 - Pause
EXE - Continue (after you have paused the game)

When you are moving left you can't just press 4 and turn left. You have to
move either up or down first, then left, and vice versa. The same applies
to up and down movement. You probably understand... :)

What more enhancements will come:

ALREDY ADDED: * Possibility to pause the game 

* High score table!

* Setup program. With this you can change various things in the game.

If you have ideas for the game then let me know: rolfk@romsdal.vgs.no


When all this has been added, then it is time to start working on

Wonderful art, huh?

It means:    SNAKE 2 !!!!!!

What I have planned for snake 2:
Instead of the usual screen:
#################
#               #
#               #
#               #
#################

I will add support for more different levels, so level 2 may look like:

####################
#                  #
#                  #
#     ########     #
#                  #
#                  #
####################

And when you hit any # you crash, got it?
And you can even add your own levels!!! Fantastic, huh? 

Have you ever played nibbles, the qbasic game which comes with M$-DOG
(MS-DOS)? My snake game will look almost like nibbles. But you have to be
patient. Remember that I go to school and don't have that much time. But
I will put it out as soon as it is finished. Send me a mail if you want me
to notify you when I have put it out or if you want me to mail you the
game or something. My email address: rolfk@romsdal.vgs.no

Any comments or suggestions are always welcome.
I am on the net every tuesday and thursday from 15.00 to 20.00 and
wednesdays from 11.00 to 12.00. I only have internet access through my
school, but I get FREE internet access there, so it is a nice offer. but
anyway, if you send me a mail on a friday for example, I'm not able to
read it until tuesday...

well, I've nothing more to say about this so here is snake 1.0 final
release:
